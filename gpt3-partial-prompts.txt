Story 3
Background: Blue is a white Tiger. Nobu is a rainbow parrot. This story takes place in a lush, green jungle at sunrise. 
Sentences: Blue the tiger sits lazily on the forest floor in a lush green jungle, yawning after his nap. Nobu the rainbow parrot sits on top of Blue’s favorite tree, chirping. “Hi Nobu!” roars Blue. He is happy to see his colorful friend after a week of no company. Being a white tiger in a large jungle meant he had to spend most of his time alone: nearly every other animal avoided him for fear of being eaten. What they didn’t realize was that Blue is actually a vegetarian! Blue the tiger watched the jungle sunrise in awe from the forest floor, while eating his delicious breakfast of red berries and leaves.  

Story 4
Background: Ollie is a white bobcat. Mai is Ollie’s kitten. The story takes place in the artic tundra. 
Sentences: Ollie and her kitten Mai are trekking through the bitter tundra snow on a cold spring day. Icy winds whip past the two cats, but luckily they have fluffy white fur that keeps them from freezing. Ollie walks very close to her kitten to shield her from the brunt of the wind and from onlooking predators, like big brown bears. Ollie and Mai make their way to the edge of the pure white ice to fish for lunch. Mai startles suddenly when she sees a huge brown bear on the distant ice, separated by a 10-meter crack in the ice.
